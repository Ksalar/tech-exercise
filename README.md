Fuigo Tech Exercise
===================

### Instructions

Your goal is to create a working version of the task manager application shown in the included screenshot using any technologies that you're comfortable with, the only requirement is that you use JavaScript for some part of it. This is an open ended exercise for you to showcase your engineering skills. Given that it is a relatively basic project, please focus on demonstrating solid programming fundamentals and good design choices both from the standpoint of what technologies to use, and then how to use them.

The functionality is broken into three main parts:

- Displaying categories and tasks
- Creating a category, and creating a task within a category
- Marking a task as complete by clicking it (and having it be crossed out), then being able to remove all completed tasks from the list

The screenshot shows the design and layout of the application. We used Twitter Bootstrap for 99% of the CSS, feel free to do the same or similar as we are not interviewing for HTML/CSS skills; our code review will focus on the programming aspects.

Once you are done please make a pull request with any instructions needed to run the application.
